Historical Stats of Uniprot

Install CRON to check for update every Monday:

  crontab -e
  # And add:

PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
MAILTO="youremail@emailprovider.com"
55 1   * * WED        ~/uniprot-stats-history/mirror-commit-push.sh



I'm now running this script on a stable server.
The CRON script will mirror Uniprot pages
every Wednesday. If there are any changes then
they will get pushed out to GitHub automatically
all versions of Unport starting from 2011_09 are indexed.
