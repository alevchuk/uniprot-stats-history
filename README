Historical Stats of Uniprot archived.

I'm now running this script (mirror-commit-push.sh) on
a stable server. The CRON script will mirror Uniprot pages
every Wednesday. If there are any changes then
they will get pushed out to GitHub automatically.

Browser viewable HTML pages are located here:
http://alevchuk.github.com/uniprot-stats-history

History of pages is here:
https://github.com/alevchuk/uniprot-stats-history

No method is yet implemented for viewing all historical pages online, so
you would need to clone the repository and view the file locally in
the web browser.



Install CRON to check for update every Monday:
  git clone git@github.com:alevchuk/uniprot-stats-history.git
  crontab -e
  # and add
* *   * * WED        ~/uniprot-stats-history/mirror-commit-push.sh
